# Student Records Database - Beginner's Guide

## What is this?
This is a simple database that helps schools keep track of students, teachers, and classes. Think of it like a digital filing cabinet for a school.

## What can it do?
- Store information about students (name, contact info, etc.)
- Keep track of teachers and what they teach
- Organize courses by department
- Record which students are taking which courses
- Store grades for each student

## Main Parts (Tables)

1. **students** - Information about each student
2. **teachers** - Information about each teacher
3. **departments** - School departments like "Math" or "English"
4. **courses** - Classes that students can take
5. **enrollments** - Shows which students are in which classes
6. **grades** - Students' grades for each class

## How it all connects

- Each **course** belongs to a **department** and is taught by a **teacher**
- **Students** sign up for **courses**, creating **enrollments**
- Each **enrollment** can have **grades** recorded for it

## Getting Started

1. Open your database program (like MySQL Workbench)
2. Copy the SQL code from the file
3. Paste it into your database program and run it
4. That's it! The database and sample data will be created
